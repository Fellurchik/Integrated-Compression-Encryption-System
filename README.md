# Integrated-Compression-Encryption-System
This repository contains the source code and benchmarking tools for the Integrated Compression-Encryption System, developed as part of my research on optimizing data security and efficiency. The system combines DEFLATE compression with AES-256 encryption to achieve a balance between storage efficiency and cryptographic strength.
